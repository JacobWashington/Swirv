## Description
Swirv is a distributive story-telling platform, where every reader can branch from an author's storyline to spin their own tale.

## Demand
Traditionally, an author's greatest responsibility has been to give their readers the full story, to leave no rock unturned. This responsibility, however, curtails the author's ability to give some of their greatest ideas life. Too many brilliant, unfinished stories have never reached readers because an author must commit themselves to the stories they can end. This diservice, to both authors and readers, is out of line with the natural ways in which stories form and develop â€” dynamically and collaboritively. By allowing every reader the opportunity to contribute to a story, or branch from a storyline at any point to forge a new journey, Swirv realigns the ancient art of storytelling with nature.
