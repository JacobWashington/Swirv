## Description

Swirv is a distributive story-telling platform, where every reader can branch from an author's storyline to spin their own tale.

## Demand

Traditionally, an author's greatest responsibility has been to give their readers the full story, to leave no rock unturned. This responsibility, however, curtails the author's ability to give some of their greatest ideas life. Too many brilliant, unfinished stories have never reached readers because an author must commit themselves to the stories they can end. This diservice, to both authors and readers, is out of line with the natural ways in which stories form and develop â€” dynamically and collaboritively. By allowing every reader the opportunity to contribute to a story, or branch from a storyline at any point to forge a new journey, Swirv realigns the ancient art of storytelling with nature.

### Vocab

**Anomaly**
: created when a user branches from an existing episode or storyline, creating an *alternate storyline* to the existing

**The Great Attractor**

## Database Architecture

**Database Edge-Cases**
- User1 deletes episode or storyline branched by User2. In this case, User1 will not actually delete the storyline/episode from the database, but will waive ownership of the content. *The Great Attractor* then becomes the owner, granting User1 anonymity without jeopardizing the branch created by User2.

## Future Development

- [ ] Tips: Users can tip an author of episodes they especially enjoyed, or to show appreciation for their favorite storylines
- [ ] 3rd Party Branching: With a URL, users can branch from 3rd party sources. Our code will then target the URL and scrape relevant content, displaying it with a reference to the source
